## Installation
* Google Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apps-in-new-tab/mpojaelnfgiajhilmojddklffggldfbp

## Description
Shows the list of installed apps instead of the search page when opening a new tab.

Waits a little before showing the app list to avoid losing the URL bar selection, allowing to press Ctrl+T and type a URL right away.
